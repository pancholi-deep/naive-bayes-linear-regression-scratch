Implement Naive Bayes and linear regression from scratch

I have tried to implement the Naive Bayes algorithm and the functions to evaluate it with a k-fold cross-validation (also from scratch). 

Calculated the accuracy of your Naive Bayes algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation on the following datasets from the UCI-Machine Learning Repository and compare your accuracy with that obtained with Naive Bayes from Weka (see NOTE 1, one comparison using hypothesis testing for each dataset between your NB implementation and Weka’s NB implementation).
• Hayes-Roth Dataset 
• Car Evaluation Dataset 
• Breast Cancer Dataset
